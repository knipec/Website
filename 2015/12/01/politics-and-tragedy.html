I've noticed on social media that people get really mad and disgusted when after a tragedy people “politicize” things. I get that. I understand that people need varying amounts of time to simply process and grieve and potentially heal after a tragedy. However, I don’t think that should preclude people from thinking of and putting forth solutions to the root causes of those tragedies, and talking about what we can do together as a society, unified in our love for each other and desire for a better world, to minimize the suffering we must endure in our future. “Political ideologies” seem to me to be reflections of our deepest core values, and I think deep down most of us want to make the world a better place, even though our perspectives for what “better” means differ drastically.

For a mediocre analogy, I wonder if to you it seems like me going to your grandma’s funeral and being like “you know, she wouldn’t have died so early if she had just smoked less”. But to me it’s like going to your grandma’s funeral with the knowledge that she died of likely preventable lung cancer, and thinking about ways we can prevent other people from suffering in the same way.

A lot of us are probably so entrenched in our political beliefs that to you it seems like we don’t care that the tragedy happened, who it affected, or how deeply it affected them. Maybe for some people that’s true. I definitely believe that some people skip the sadness and just see an opportunity to get the public to go along with their ego-driven desires, lacking empathy or a true interest in improving the lived experiences of anyone but themselves. But I also believe that for many of us with strong political convictions, we acknowledge the deep sadness we feel now, and remember the sadness we have felt from tragedies before. And, we are desperately yearning for a way to avoid feeling the same sadness yet again. Because with this sadness also comes anger. Anger that this tragedy happened. Anger that similar tragedies have been happening over and over, and nothing is done about it because people want to grieve first and “politicize” never. “Politics” (or whatever you want to call it) governs how we are able and allowed to live in this world, and working to change them means working towards a world that is radically more beautiful than the one we are in now.
