title: Critical Issues in the Arts
description: >
  This was a book I made in college after taking a seminar in which we read critic after critic assigning arbitrary value judgements to things in the world that they decided were or were not in the category of "art". I wrote a rather grumpy artist statement to go along with it, but I'll save you from that here.
