    <div>
        Hi, I'm Carissa. I'm currently in Seattle, WA, and I make stuff that people call art. Sometimes my arts practice is around any or none of the following:
    </div>
    <br>
    <ul>
        <li>Art I make is a little part of myself that I can share with others (and/or is for myself)</li>
        <li>Trying to dream of a world of radical compassion and acceptance, where we are growing and healing and imagining and building and being and maybe it's beautiful</li>
        <li>Plants! They're so cool!</li>
        <li>Things! They're kinda funny, or sad, or interesting sometimes!</li>
        <li>Making art can be fun, an enjoyable challenge, and/or relaxing, and I think we deserve all that in this life</li>
